## 🚀 About Me

I'm an **Computer Systems Engineer**  with a strong interest in **software development**, **frontend engineering**, and **UI/UX design**. I enjoy building practical applications that solve real-world problems and learning new technologies along the way.

I have experience working on academic, personal, and service projects, and I'm especially motivated to grow as a **frontend developer** while I improve my problem-solving and design skills.
